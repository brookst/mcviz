MCViz
=====
...because a graph is worth a thousand lists.

Preface
-------

Welcome! `MCViz` was started at the _European School of High Energy Physics 2010_,
during a `pythia` lecture where a couple of confused students were staring at a
list of a thousand particles particicpating in a 
[QCD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) event.

"What does this *look* like?!", we asked ourselves. We realised in short order 
that a few simple instructions to the excellent [graphviz](http://graphviz.org), 
we could see the connections between everything before our eyes.

.. very quickly we found ourselves knee-deep in ideas and desire to explore the
beautiful mess infront of us. `MCViz` is the result of our exploration.

`MCViz` is intended to be a tool for novices to have a quick play around in, or 
for more serious users and people who need to explore generator information
to make sense of what is going on.

Getting Started
---------------

You will need:

* [graphviz](http://graphviz.org). (Present on [lxplus](http://plus.web.cern.ch/plus/))
* An SVG viewer. (We recommend [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org))
* Life will be easier if you have a linux machine, since this is what we have 
  developed and tested it on. ([Feedback](http://github.com/pwaller/mcviz/issues) 
  is encouraged and welcome !)

The easy way:
    $ mkdir mcviz && cd mcviz
    $ wget (http://github.com/pwaller/mcviz/raw/dev/mcviz_bootstrap.py)[http://github.com/pwaller/mcviz/raw/dev/mcviz_bootstrap.py]
    $ ./bootstrap.py # Creates a [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.openplans.org/) 
                     # environment the current working directory where mcviz will 
                     # be installed.
    $ source env/bin/activate # Activates the environment (puts mcviz in $PATH)
    $ mcviz [path/to/input.hepmc]
    $ inkscape mcviz.svg
    $ mcviz --help # Explore the options!
